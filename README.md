# Robot-Modelling
This repository contains several 3D models created for the activities of Topic 3 (3D Modeling) of the Robots Software subject of Software Engineering Bachellor in Uniovi.

## Original designs
The original designs of the different pieces are available at https://www.thingiverse.com/. The files of this repository try to replicate some of the projects present there to understand the creation of 3D models and the use of the OpenSCAD tool.
